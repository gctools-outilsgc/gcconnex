GCTools Hackathon: GCConnex Reading List & Outlook Event Bridge
Team: Leeroy Jenkins – Stephen Arsenault, Francis Grignon, Pascal St-Denis, Li Wang
The Reading List plugin for GCConnex extends bookmarks by creating a list for items to be read a later time. The plugin is designed as a sub section of bookmarks and meant to declutter the bookmarks of items that are only needed temporarily (ie. blog post). An entity menu is added to blogs to provide a quick and easy one-click add to the reading list.

Events in GCConnex are isolated and can be easily missed or get double booked. The Outlook Event Bridge adds import and export of GCConnex events to and from Outlook. By having GCConnex in Outlook and vice versa, it is much easier to keep track and be reminded of events
