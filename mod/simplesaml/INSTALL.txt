= Installation instructions =

This installation instruction is mostly beased on SimpleSAMLPHP v1.5 some parts could be different in newer versions.

In order to use a CAS server as the IDentity Provider you'll need SimpleSAMLPHP version >= 1.6

== Step 1: SimpleSAMLPHP installation ==

Also see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-install>

1. Download the SimpleSAMLPHP library from <http://simplesamlphp.org/download>, we recommend you use the latest stable release.
2. Upload the contents of the release to your webserver OUTSIDE the webdirectory (eq htdocs)
3. Add an alias to your website configuration /simplesaml which points to the www directory in the SimpleSAMLPHP installation
4. Edit /config/config.php and fill in the following options
	- auth.adminpassword => this is the password for the admin part of SimpleSAMLPHP (remember this)
	- secretsalt => generate a salt for signing of the communication (use a-z0-9) (don't need to remember this)
	- technicalcontact_name => the name of the webmaster
	- technicalcontact_email => the email address of the webmaster (error reports wil go here)
	- language.default => (optional) is different from English
	- timezone => Set it to your timezone
5. Edit /www/_include.php before all code add
	- require_once(path_to_your_elgg_installation . "/engine/start.php");

== Step 2: Configuration as a ServiceProvider ==

Follow these instructions of you want to login to your Elgg site by using an other site as the IDentity Provider.

=== Step 2.1: SimpleSAMLPHP configuration ===

==== 2.1.1 Connecting to a SAML IDentity Provider ====
Also see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-sp>

1. generate a SSL certificate in the /cert directory
	- example command: openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out saml.crt -keyout saml.pem
2. For each IDP you wish to connect to:
	- add a new config to /config/authsources.php (see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-sp#section_1>)
		- The config also needs to return some extra field, this can be copied/created from the return result
		- The Elgg plugin can handle
			- elgg:firstname => The firstname (givenname) of the user
			- elgg:lastname => the lastname (surname) of the user (optional)
			- elgg:email => the email address of the user (optional, when missing will be asked)
			- elgg:external_id => a persistend unique id for this user (required, but can also be collected in a different way)
			- elgg:username => a unique username for the user. This will be used when creating a user (if still available in Elgg)
	- add the new entityID to /metadata/saml20-idp-remote.php (see http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-sp#section_2)

==== 2.1.2 Connecting to a CAS IDentity Provider ====
Also see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.6/cas:cas>

1. enable CAS support by creating a file 'enable' in /modules/cas
2. For each IDP you wish to connect to:
	- add a new config to /config/authsources.php (see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.6/cas:cas#section_2>)
		- The config also needs to return some extra field, this can be copied/created from the return result
		- The Elgg plugin can handle
			- elgg:firstname => The firstname (givenname) of the user
			- elgg:lastname => the lastname (surname) of the user (optional)
			- elgg:email => the email address of the user (optional, when missing will be asked)
			- elgg:external_id => a persistend unique id for this user (required, but can also be collected in a different way)
			- elgg:username => a unique username for the user. This will be used when creating a user (if still available in Elgg)

=== Step 2.2: Elgg configuration, first part ===

1. Extract this plugin
2. Upload it to your /mod folder
3. Goto Admistration -> Plugins
4. Enable the SimpleSAML plugin
5. Goto the settings of the SimpleSAML plugin
6. Fill in the path to the SimplSAMLPHP installation
7. Fill in what you used as the alias for SimpleSAMLPHP
8. Save the settings

=== Step 2.3: Elgg configuration, second part ===

If you completed Step 3 successfully your configured IDPs should be listed.

Further configuration should be self explanatory.

== Step 3: Configuration as an IDentity Provider ==

If you want your Elgg site to be the authentication system for some other site, follow these instructions.

=== Step 3.1: SimpleSAMLPHP configuration ===

Also see <http://simplesamlphp.org/docs/1.5/simplesamlphp-idp>

1. In config/config.php enable 'enable.saml20-idp'
2. Copy the contents of mod/simplesaml/vendors/simplesaml/modules to the modules directory of your SimpleSAMLPHP directory.
3. Edit config/authsources.php to configure a new authentication source
	- you can use this example:
	
		`'elgg-idp' => array(  
			'authelgg:External',  
			'privatekey'  => '<your private certificate key>',  
			'certificate' => '<your private certificate>',  
		),`
4. Edit metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php to setup the IDP
	- you can use this example:
	
		`$metadata['__DYNAMIC:1__'] = array(
			'host' => '__DEFAULT__',
			'privatekey' => '<your private certificate key>',
			'certificate' => '<your private certificate>',
			'auth' => '<the name you configured above>',
		);`
5. For each Service Provider you wish to support you need to include a config in metadata/saml20-sp-remove.php

=== Step 3.2: Elgg configuration === 

1. Follow the step described in 2.2
2. You can configure which profile data is exported in the authentication challenge, if you leave the SAML name fields empty the data will NOT be exported.
