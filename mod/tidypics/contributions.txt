Version 1.8.1beta12 Change List
Release Date: 02/01/2014
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.8.1beta12 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added placeholder images to be displayed in case no images have been uploaded to an album yet in the image sizes previously missing,
 * On deletion of an album the corresponding album folder in data directory gets deleted and no longer the (empty) album folder remains,
 * Flash uploader fixed in the case of group albums when someone else than the album creator wants to upload images to a group album,
 * Navigation arrows hidden if an album contains only a single image,
 * Correction of title of group pages "Most recent albums" widget,
 * "View all" link in Latest Photos widget on profile pages working for site visitors not logged in,
 * Fixed list of offered existing albums to select from for image uploads when in group context,
 * Fixed display of image and album gallery pages when images or albums exist that belong to groups with restricted access (The images or albums shown in the gallery pages depend on the viewing user having the necessary right for viewing depending on the access level defined for these albums including the images within these albums. For example a user gets to see all albums with "public" access level regardless if logged in or not. But if you set the access level "public" or "logged in" for a group album this results in even a non-group member being able to get access to such albums and their content. But if the group itself is a restricted group certain problems arise when this group contains "public" or "logged-in" content. In case of the gallery views within Tidypics the outcome is a fatal error occuring on these pages. This fix avoids the fatal error from happening. Still the group images and albums of restricted albums are included in the listings due to the access level set for them. If you don't want any albums or images of restricted groups to be seen by non-group-members you must set the access level of these albums to the corresponding group's level).

Version 1.8.1beta11 Change List
Release Date: 01/09/2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.8.1beta11 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some general code cleanup,
 * Fix of river entries appearing twice on image uploads in case the Flash uploader is used and the plugin option is set to create separate entries for each uploaded image (issue introduced in beta10),
 * Added TidypicsBatch class (that extends ElggObject class) used for creation of objects of subtype "tidypics_batch" (used for handling "batches" of uploaded images) instead of creation the objects as ElggObject and assinging the subtype,
 * Improvements on slideshow:
   - a slideshow can be started on all pages that display a suitable list of images (but the slideshow feature is only available if the slideshow plugin option introduced in beta10 is enabled in the plugin settings),
   - start of slideshow via title menu button,
   - slideshow will include the next 64 images (i.e. 5 pages of images) of the current displayed image list taking into account the current page offset (i.e. on page 1 the slideshow will display pages 1-5 while on page 10 it will display the images of pages 10-14 etc.). (Longtime goal for future Tidypics versions: no limitation of number of images in slideshow and most likely replacing the PicLensLite slideshow by something else / something better. Currently, the number of images to be included in a slideshow is somewhat limited by avoiding running into memory issues. Also, the PicLensLite slideshow library requires the Flash plugin on client browsers which is annoying and the 3D wall feature does no longer work),
 * Improvements on image orientation correction at image uploading:
   - using best methods available depending on image library selected,
   - update orientation information saved in image file after a change of image orientation if the image library used supports this (GD library unfortunately does not support it but the exif info saved in the image file is lost on image orientation correction anyway),
   - support of orientation correction not only of rotated but also of mirrowed (and possibly additionally rotated) images,
   - some remarks regarding which image library to use for Tidypics:
     * if possible and available on your server use the "ImageMagick executable". Generally, this library has a much smaller memory requirement compared to the GD library both for image resizing (i.e. creation of thumbnail preview images) and orientation correction of images. Additionally, the exif information saved in an image file will be preserved both during resizing and orientation correction processing,
     * next best choice after "ImageMagick executable" is the "imagick PHP extension". It also has a low memory consumption compared to the GD library but you might lose exif information during image processing,
     * the GD library should be available on any server (as Elgg core requires it anyway). The memory requirement of the GD library can be quite high both for creation of thumbnails and image orientation corrections. The memory requirement is depending not on the image file size in the first place but on image resolution, color depth per pixel and color channels per pixel (so even a small sized image file might require more memory than available on the server). If you use the GD library for Tidypics on your server, your users might not be able to upload larger images. Additionaly, exif information saved in the image files might get lost during image orientation correction.

Version 1.8.1beta10 Change List
Release Date: 17/08/2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.8.1beta10 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some preparations for compatibility with Elgg 1.9 (though I will release a separate version of Tidypics for Elgg 1.9!),
 * Replacement of a deprecated function,
 * Small improvement in Flash uploader error handling,
 * New plugin option: use of slideshow optional,
 * Fixed check of memory requirement for image re-sizing on upload when using GD php extension,

 * New tab on Tidypics plugin settings: image deletion by providing GUID of image (in case the image entry can't be deleted via site front-end),
 * Includes the following changes in Tidypics from official Tidypics repo at https://github.com/cash/Tidypics:
    - correction of text in notifications about image uploads in case the uploader is not the owner of the album.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.8.1beta8 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Requires Elgg 1.8.16 due to bugfix https://github.com/Elgg/Elgg/issues/5564 for the pagination on list pages to work,
 * Pagination support for the list pages (like "Most views" / "Recently commented" etc.) to show more than only a hardcoded number of photos in each list view,
 * List pages (like "Most views" / "Recently commented" etc.) to work correctly when logged out and to show only photos that the viewer is allowed to see based on access level settings,

 * Improvements in handling Tidypics user and word tags of images (including CSS improvements) to play well together with the Image entidy tags (avoiding double tags to be added, removal of corresponding Image entity tags when an Tidypics image word tag is removed),
 * River entry on adding word tags to an image,
 * Includes the following changes in Tidypics from official Tidypics repo at https://github.com/cash/Tidypics:
    - made the albums notifications overridable rather than calling object_notifications() directly,
    - fixed: security issue with showing malicious exif data.

 * Includes the following changes in Tidypics from official Tidypics repo at https://github.com/cash/Tidypics:
    - set tiny size for sites that may not have it set (e.g. possibly sites updated from Elgg 1.6) (by Cash Costello),
    - stripping non word characters from title when pulled from image filename (by Cash Costello),
    - added tagging to river with notification to user (by Cash Costello, Kevin Jardine).

Version 1.8.1beta6 Change List
Release Date: 28/04/2013
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.8.1beta6 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fix for Tidypics to work in Elgg 1.8.15 (creating new albums),
 * Updated uploadify flash uploader to version 3.2 (this might only be a preliminary solution as I might need to switch to another flash (html5) uploader as the Uploadify uploader has some limitations and also seems no longer fully supported),
 * Fixed some deprecated function calls (they were not in actively used code but some people might have wondered about it nonetheless as the Code Analyzer plugin gave some warnings about them),
 * Fixed html code in widgets' content.php for better theme compatibility (as suggested by ura soul).

Contributors:
  * Gabriel Monge-Franco (http://gabriel.mongefranco.com)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.08.2 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.08.1 that broke the picture upload (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Fixed empty variables in several files that were supposed to send the user back to the previous page, but didn't.
* Cleaned up change log (contributions.txt).
* Finally fixed the Polish language file!!! Yay!! :)

* TODO: Work around large image (high resolution) limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly or ImageMagic if available)
  - The problem is with get_resized_image_from_existing_file().  Submitted a ticket to the Elgg tracking bug system.
  - Edit actions/upload.php when done. There is a dirty hack in place for now that needs to be removed once the above bug is fixed.
* TODO: disable public by default (input/accessRead.php) -- add setting to admin page that lets the site admin decide whether pictures can be public or not.
* TODO: allow group members to add pictures to group photo albums
* TODO: implement photo anotations
* TODO: look into replacing individual image views with lightbox2 or jQuery lightbox album views.
* TODO: create a new widget to show pictures (in slideshow) in a user's profile.
* TODO: add settings for group albums so that the group owner can select the number of albums to show.
* TODO: implement a way to move pictures from one album to another (should be pretty easy).
* TODO: add an "Add Photos" option to the user widget similar to the one in the group widget.
* TODO: implement automagic file resizing to meet the admin's maximum resolution and file size.

* OF NOTE: It is currently not possible to allow group members to edit an album created by another group member.  This is a bug with group permissions and it will probably not be fixed until [at least] Elgg v1.5 comes out.

BEGIN VERSION 1.08.1 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.08 that caused fake files to be created during thumbnail creation (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Reverted to old directory structure that saves pictures to /image/ALBUMGUID/picGUID (v1.08 saved to /image/ALBUMGUID__picGUID, thus keeping everything in one folder).
* Album directory is now deleted when the album is deleted (along with every picture inside of the album).
* Reverted thumbnail and small thumbnail to use picture cropping instead of scaling, so that sites that already use Tidypics can keep a consisting look and feel.
* Completed River integration by moving album and image directories to an "object" sub-directory (thanks to LKLaRose).
* Added status messages/graphics to give the user some feedback.
* Fixed bug in profile widget whereby the selected number of albums had no effect (thanks to @Webgalli and @cheltenham).
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.06 that prevented anonymous users from viewing a user's album (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Fixed more language file bugs (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Administrators can now set a file size limit from the plugin configuration (it has to be in Kilobytes).

* JUST PLAIN WEIRD:  Fixed Polish language file (thanks to @Vazco, Ian Medlock and Brett Profitt) and saved as UTF8 without BOM.  However, it still doesn't work.  Can somebody try saving it on a Polish box for me? :)

* TODO: fix Polish language file -- it seems to break the whole Elgg site! Maybe it needs to use HTML codes in place of international characters?
* TODO: Work around large image (high resolution) limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly or ImageMagic if available)

  - Since deleting directories was not possible without the use of unsafe file operations, albums no longer create new directories.  Instead, all pictures are saved as /image/ALBUMGUID__picturename.
* Fixed some bugs in the English, Spanish and German language files and added missing error messages.
* Thumbnails now display the default error image (same as new album) when the requested image cannot be found.
* Fixed a bug in the multi-edit form that did not allow image titles to be saved.
* Removed some customizations made to edit.php action in v1.07 since they removed the ability to add titles to images.
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.07 that prevented images from being set as album covers.
* Fixed miscellaneous bugs in group albums widget.
* Removed jQuery for now since it was making the albums too slow.  In the future, we should look into replacing individual image views with lightbox2 or jQuery lightbox album views.


* TODO: fix Polish language file -- it seems to break the whole Elgg site! Maybe it needs to use HTML codes in place of international characters?
* TODO: Work around 0.9MB source file size limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly)
  - The problem is with get_resized_image_from_existing_file().  Submitted a ticket to the Elgg tracking bug system.
  - Edit actions/upload.php when done. There is a dirty hack in place for now that needs to be removed once the above bug is fixed.
* TODO: disable public by default (input/accessRead.php) -- add setting to admin page that lets the site admin decide whether pictures can be public or not.
* TODO: allow group members to add pictures to group photo albums
* TODO: implement photo anotations
* TODO: look into replacing individual image views with lightbox2 or jQuery lightbox album views.

* OF NOTE: It is currently not possible to allow group members to edit an album created by another group member.  This is a bug with group permissions and it will probably not be fixed until [at least] Elgg v1.5 comes out.

Version 1.06 Change List
Release Date: 02/03/2008

------------------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN VERSION 1.06 CHANGES
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Forward all non-logged in users to World (public) pictures. This fixes a bug in which anonymous users would see a list of pictures titled, "'s pictures" (without a name).
* Forward requests to "owned" without an user ID to "owned/userid" when a user is logged in. This fixes a bug in which all users would see a list of pictures titled, "'s pictures" (without a name).
* Replaced several hard-coded strings to elgg_echo() functions so they can be translated.
* Re-enabled title entry in picture editing. Titles are only optional, so there is no reason to hide them, especially if some users may find them useful.  Moreover, lack of image titles makes list views awkward.
* Fixed multi-picture editing bug in which editing was disabled after uploading multiple pictures.
* Fixed several tags not conforming to standard PHP opening tags.
* Fixed some bugs in the English language file.
* Added Spanish and German translations (if you speak German, please double-check the language file!!!).
* Added a download link at the bottom of each picture to download the original file.
* Updated some icons and created missing ones.

* TODO: disable public by default (input/accessRead.php) -- add setting to admin page that lets the site admin decide whether pictures can be public or not.
* TODO: change ugly "new album" picture into something better looking.
* TODO: re-organize files to clean up the plug-in directory (e.g., move world.php to views/default)
* TODO: Fix bug whereby image objects are deleted from the database, but the physical files remain on the server.  The path can be found with $file->getFilename(), but would it be safe to execute shell commands directly???
