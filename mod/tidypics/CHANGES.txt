Version 1.9.4.1 (Release Date: 17/11/2014)
------------------------------------------

* Added Tidypics upgrade script to be executed after upgrading a site to Elgg 1.9.5 to catch any comments made on images and albums possibly not yet upgraded by Tidypics previously due to a bug in Elgg core resulting in the comments migration when upgrading from Elgg 1.8 left incomplete (fixed in Elgg 1.9.5).
BEFORE running the Tidypics upgrade (from Tidypics' settings page) check for any pending Elgg core upgrades and if there are any (especially comments migration!) FIRST run the core upgrades. Depending on the number of comments on your site the Tidypics upgrade might take a while to finish. In any case, make a database backup before running the Tidypics upgrade!

* "Create album" link removed from groups images profile module / widget for for non-members of groups,
* Disable unintended text shadow within html5 uploader at least in some cases if this text styling has been enabled by other plugins and unwantedly inherited by plupload (can't prevent text shadow in all circumstances as a theme plugin might override Tidypics' CSS).

Version 1.9.1beta13 (Release Date: 02/04/2014)
----------------------------------------------

ATTENTION: before executing the upgrade script that comes with this version you should have finished the upgrade process of Elgg core from 1.8 to 1.9 if you are not starting on a fresh Elgg 1.9 installation. It's important that all existing comment annotations have already been converted to comment entities. And PLEASE BACKUP YOUR DATABASE before executing the Tidypics upgrade. The backup is important because the script might possibly take some time to finish depending on how many database entries are in need to be updated.

* Same code base as 1.8.1beta13 with necessary modifications to work on Elgg 1.9,
* The upgrade script that comes with this version does basically the same as the upgrade script included in 1.8.1beta13: comments formerly made on the activity page are assigned to the uploaded image (on single image uploads) or albums. This is necessary for all existing comments to show up in the same way as future comments. The comments will still be displayed on the activity page but in addition also automatically on image pages or album pages respectively. In addition to the changes done by the Elgg 1.8 version of Tidypics 1.8.1beta13 the version for Elgg 1.9 also restores the specific Tidypics comment views (with thumbnails) on the activity page that were changed to a default comments view by Elgg core when upgrading to 1.9.

Version 1.8.1beta13 (Release Date: 01/04/2014)
----------------------------------------------

ATTENTION: this new release contains an update script that changes database entries related to comments and likes made on Tidypics image upload river entries. Read the changelog carefully BEFORE running the upgrade to understand what it does and in any case make a database backup before executing the upgrade to be able to revert to the former state if you are not content with the result. The backup is also important because the script might possibly take some time to finish depending on how many database entries are in need to be updated.

* Code cleanup,
* Flash uploader: limit number of images that can be added in one go to 10,
* Fix on friends tab pages of "All Photos" and "All photo albums" to check if user has friends and display a fitting message if not instead of saying the friends would not have uploaded image yet (which shows when the user has friends but they have not yet uploaded images),
* Removed plugin setting to turn commenting on albums on/off. Commenting on albums is now always on,
* Commenting on image uploads on the Activity page (commenting on Tidypics_batch entities): when commenting on an upload of a single image the comment will be added to this image and when commenting on an upload of more than a single image the comment will be added to the corresponding album (in both cases the comment made will still be shown also on the activity page below this river entry),
* the same with liking image uploads entries on the Activity page: if a single image was uploaded this image will get the like and if more than a single image was uploaded the corresponding album will get the like (in both cases the like will also be shown on the activity page in the river menu of this entry),
* IMPORTANT!!!!!! Please read: upgrade script to assign existing comments and likes made on image upload river entries either to the corresponding image or album. This script makes the existing comments and likes consistent with the future comments and likes created on Tidypics 1.8.1beta13. The update script (mod/tidypics/upgrades/2013121201.php) does the folling:
	1. upgrading of comments on river entries that were made with Tidypics 1.8.0rc1 or earlier,
	2. slightly different procedure for upgrading comments on river entries made with a Tidypics 1.8.1betaXX version: for these comments a second database entry was created for the comment to show not only on the activity page but also on the albums' pages. The upgrade script identifies these second comment entries by the lack of corresponding river entries in the database and then deletes these entries. If you have by any means deleted entries on the activity page informing about comments made on album pages or if you prevent such entries to be created on your site somehow then these comments will also get deleted. Unfortunately, there's no other way of getting rid of the duplicate comments entries that are now no longer needed. If in doubt, comment out "Part 3" of the upgrade code in mod/tidypics/upgrades/2013121201.php.
	3. upgrading of likes on river entries: here's a check included if a user has already liked the album or image the like made to the river entry would get moved to. If there's not already an existing like the like will get moved from the river entry and added to the album/image. If the user has already liked the image or corresponding album the like will not get added to avoid duplicate likings.

Version 1.9.1beta12 (Release Date: 03/01/2014)
----------------------------------------------

* Same code base as 1.8.1beta12 with necessary modifications to work on Elgg 1.9,
* addtional Elgg 1.9 specific changes:
	- Fix of some deprecation issues that turned up on Elgg 1.9,
	- Fix of "Recently commented  photos" and "Most commented..." pages to work again on Elgg 1.9 (necessary due to the change in Elgg 1.9 of handling comments as ElggComment entities instead of annotations),
	- Fix of river comment entries to optionally include a thumbnail of the image / the album cover to work again on Elgg 1.9 (ATTENTION: only new river entries will show the thumbnail images automatically. For getting existing river entries - especially entries created on Elgg 1.8 previously - to also show the thumbnail images again you will have to execute an upgrade script. You can execute this script by clicking on the "Upgrade" button on the Tidypics settings page. BEFORE executing the Tidypics-specific upgrade FIRST execute any outstanding upgrades of Elgg 1.9 core - especially the migration of all comment annotations to the new Elgg comment objects!!!).

Version 1.8.1beta12 (Release Date: 02/01/2014)
----------------------------------------------

* Added placeholder images to be displayed in case no images have been uploaded to an album yet in the image sizes previously missing,
* On deletion of an album the corresponding album folder in data directory gets deleted and no longer the (empty) album folder remains,
* Flash uploader fixed in the case of group albums when someone else than the album creator wants to upload images to a group album,
* Navigation arrows hidden if an album contains only a single image,
* Correction of title of group pages "Most recent albums" widget,
* "View all" link in Latest Photos widget on profile pages working for site visitors not logged in,
* Fixed list of offered existing albums to select from for image uploads when in group context,
* Fixed display of image and album gallery pages when images or albums exist that belong to groups with restricted access (The images or albums shown in the gallery pages depend on the viewing user having the necessary right for viewing depending on the access level defined for these albums including the images within these albums. For example a user gets to see all albums with "public" access level regardless if logged in or not. But if you set the access level "public" or "logged in" for a group album this results in even a non-group member being able to get access to such albums and their content. But if the group itself is a restricted group certain problems arise when this group contains "public" or "logged-in" content. In case of the gallery views within Tidypics the outcome is a fatal error occuring on these pages. This fix avoids the fatal error from happening. Still the group images and albums of restricted albums are included in the listings due to the access level set for them. If you don't want any albums or images of restricted groups to be seen by non-group-members you must set the access level of these albums to the corresponding group's level).

Version 1.8.1beta11 (Release Date: 01/09/2013)
----------------------------------------------

* Some general code cleanup,
* Fix of river entries appearing twice on image uploads in case the Flash uploader is used and the plugin option is set to create separate entries for each uploaded image (issue introduced in beta10),
* Added TidypicsBatch class (that extends ElggObject class) used for creation of objects of subtype "tidypics_batch" (used for handling "batches" of uploaded images) instead of creation the objects as ElggObject and assinging the subtype,
* Improvements on slideshow:
	- a slideshow can be started on all pages that display a suitable list of images (but the slideshow feature is only available if the slideshow plugin option introduced in beta10 is enabled in the plugin settings),
	- start of slideshow via title menu button,
	- slideshow will include the next 64 images (i.e. 5 pages of images) of the current displayed image list taking into account the current page offset (i.e. on page 1 the slideshow will display pages 1-5 while on page 10 it will display the images of pages 10-14 etc.). (Longtime goal for future Tidypics versions: no limitation of number of images in slideshow and most likely replacing the PicLensLite slideshow by something else / something better. Currently, the number of images to be included in a slideshow is somewhat limited by avoiding running into memory issues. Also, the PicLensLite slideshow library requires the Flash plugin on client browsers which is annoying and the 3D wall feature does no longer work),
* Improvements on image orientation correction at image uploading:
	- using best methods available depending on image library selected,
	- update orientation information saved in image file after a change of image orientation if the image library used supports this (GD library unfortunately does not support it but the exif info saved in the image file is lost on image orientation correction anyway),
	- support of orientation correction not only of rotated but also of mirrowed (and possibly additionally rotated) images,
	- some remarks regarding which image library to use for Tidypics:
* if possible and available on your server use the "ImageMagick executable". Generally, this library has a much smaller memory requirement compared to the GD library both for image resizing (i.e. creation of thumbnail preview images) and orientation correction of images. Additionally, the exif information saved in an image file will be preserved both during resizing and orientation correction processing,
* next best choice after "ImageMagick executable" is the "imagick PHP extension". It also has a low memory consumption compared to the GD library but you might lose exif information during image processing,
* the GD library should be available on any server (as Elgg core requires it anyway). The memory requirement of the GD library can be quite high both for creation of thumbnails and image orientation corrections. The memory requirement is depending not on the image file size in the first place but on image resolution, color depth per pixel and color channels per pixel (so even a small sized image file might require more memory than available on the server). If you use the GD library for Tidypics on your server, your users might not be able to upload larger images. Additionaly, exif information saved in the image files might get lost during image orientation correction.

* River entry on adding word tags to an image,
* Includes the following changes in Tidypics from official Tidypics repo at https://github.com/cash/Tidypics:
	- made the albums notifications overridable rather than calling object_notifications() directly,
	- fixed: security issue with showing malicious exif data.

---------------------------------------------

* Fix for Tidypics to work in Elgg 1.8.15 (creating new albums),
* Updated uploadify flash uploader to version 3.2 (this might only be a preliminary solution as I might need to switch to another flash (html5) uploader as the Uploadify uploader has some limitations and also seems no longer fully supported),

Version 1.08.2 (Release Date: 02/13/2008)
-----------------------------------------

* Fixed bug introduced in v1.08.1 that broke the picture upload (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Fixed empty variables in several files that were supposed to send the user back to the previous page, but didn't.
* Cleaned up change log (contributions.txt).
* Finally fixed the Polish language file!!! Yay!! :)
* TODO: Work around large image (high resolution) limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly or ImageMagic if available)
	- The problem is with get_resized_image_from_existing_file().  Submitted a ticket to the Elgg tracking bug system.
	- Edit actions/upload.php when done. There is a dirty hack in place for now that needs to be removed once the above bug is fixed.
* TODO: disable public by default (input/accessRead.php) -- add setting to admin page that lets the site admin decide whether pictures can be public or not.
* TODO: allow group members to add pictures to group photo albums
* TODO: implement photo anotations
* TODO: look into replacing individual image views with lightbox2 or jQuery lightbox album views.
* TODO: create a new widget to show pictures (in slideshow) in a user's profile.
* TODO: add settings for group albums so that the group owner can select the number of albums to show.
* TODO: implement a way to move pictures from one album to another (should be pretty easy).
* TODO: add an "Add Photos" option to the user widget similar to the one in the group widget.
* TODO: implement automagic file resizing to meet the admin's maximum resolution and file size.
* OF NOTE: It is currently not possible to allow group members to edit an album created by another group member.  This is a bug with group permissions and it will probably not be fixed until [at least] Elgg v1.5 comes out.

Version 1.08.1 (Release Date: 02/13/2008)
-----------------------------------------

* Fixed bug introduced in v1.08 that caused fake files to be created during thumbnail creation (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Reverted to old directory structure that saves pictures to /image/ALBUMGUID/picGUID (v1.08 saved to /image/ALBUMGUID__picGUID, thus keeping everything in one folder).
* Album directory is now deleted when the album is deleted (along with every picture inside of the album).
* Reverted thumbnail and small thumbnail to use picture cropping instead of scaling, so that sites that already use Tidypics can keep a consisting look and feel.
* Completed River integration by moving album and image directories to an "object" sub-directory (thanks to LKLaRose).
* Added status messages/graphics to give the user some feedback.
* Fixed bug in profile widget whereby the selected number of albums had no effect (thanks to @Webgalli and @cheltenham).
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.06 that prevented anonymous users from viewing a user's album (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Fixed more language file bugs (thanks to Karsten Schulze).
* Administrators can now set a file size limit from the plugin configuration (it has to be in Kilobytes).
* JUST PLAIN WEIRD:  Fixed Polish language file (thanks to @Vazco, Ian Medlock and Brett Profitt) and saved as UTF8 without BOM. However, it still doesn't work. Can somebody try saving it on a Polish box for me? :)
* TODO: fix Polish language file -- it seems to break the whole Elgg site! Maybe it needs to use HTML codes in place of international characters?
* TODO: Work around large image (high resolution) limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly or ImageMagic if available)

Version 1.08 (Release Date: 02/08/2008)
---------------------------------------

* Merged most (safe) changes made by other contributors in v1.07.
	- Did not include SWFuploader or JQuery due to the number of bugs reported.
* Changed ugly "new album" picture into something better looking.
* Fixed bug whereby image objects were deleted from the database, but they physical files remained on the server.
	- Since deleting directories was not possible without the use of unsafe file operations, albums no longer create new directories.  Instead, all pictures are saved as /image/ALBUMGUID__picturename.
* Fixed some bugs in the English, Spanish and German language files and added missing error messages.
* Thumbnails now display the default error image (same as new album) when the requested image cannot be found.
* Fixed a bug in the multi-edit form that did not allow image titles to be saved.
* Removed some customizations made to edit.php action in v1.07 since they removed the ability to add titles to images.
* Fixed bug introduced in v1.07 that prevented images from being set as album covers.
* Fixed miscellaneous bugs in group albums widget.
* Removed jQuery for now since it was making the albums too slow.  In the future, we should look into replacing individual image views with lightbox2 or jQuery lightbox album views.
* TODO: fix Polish language file -- it seems to break the whole Elgg site! Maybe it needs to use HTML codes in place of international characters?
* TODO: Work around 0.9MB source file size limit when creating thumbnails (an Elgg limitation... can probably be fixed by using PHP GD functions directly)
	- The problem is with get_resized_image_from_existing_file().  Submitted a ticket to the Elgg tracking bug system.

Version 1.06 (Release Date: 02/03/2008)
---------------------------------------

* Forward all non-logged in users to World (public) pictures. This fixes a bug in which anonymous users would see a list of pictures titled, "'s pictures" (without a name).
* Forward requests to "owned" without an user ID to "owned/userid" when a user is logged in. This fixes a bug in which all users would see a list of pictures titled, "'s pictures" (without a name).
* Replaced several hard-coded strings to elgg_echo() functions so they can be translated.
* Re-enabled title entry in picture editing. Titles are only optional, so there is no reason to hide them, especially if some users may find them useful.  Moreover, lack of image titles makes list views awkward.
* Fixed multi-picture editing bug in which editing was disabled after uploading multiple pictures.
* Fixed several tags not conforming to standard PHP opening tags.
* Fixed some bugs in the English language file.
* Added Spanish and German translations (if you speak German, please double-check the language file!!!).
* Added a download link at the bottom of each picture to download the original file.
* Updated some icons and created missing ones.
* TODO: disable public by default (input/accessRead.php) -- add setting to admin page that lets the site admin decide whether pictures can be public or not.
* TODO: change ugly "new album" picture into something better looking.
* TODO: re-organize files to clean up the plug-in directory (e.g., move world.php to views/default)
* TODO: Fix bug whereby image objects are deleted from the database, but the physical files remain on the server.  The path can be found with $file->getFilename(), but would it be safe to execute shell commands directly???
