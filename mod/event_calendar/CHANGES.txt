Changelog
=========

2.0.0 (iionly)
--------------

- Updated for Elgg 2.0 (therefore should also work on future Elgg 2.X versions).

1.10.3 (iionly)
---------------

- Conversion all JS code to AMD modules,
- Fix for event calendar's entries on group profile pages (with and without Widget Manager plugin used) to work correctly depending on the state of the corresponding Event Calendar plugin settings for group calendars,
- Fixed region event filter to work correctly with fullcalendar,
- Usage of profile images of event creators as event icon in lists and on the activity page instead of generic event icon,
- Cleanup of unused image files,
- "Add event" link added in group's event widget (when Widget Manager is used to manage group widgets),
- Line break added before "Add event" link in group module (when Widget Manager not used) when no group events exist,
- Cleanup of code used to display event infos in calendar list views to prevent an empty line to be added after the info,
- New tool ("Administer" - "Utilities" - "Event Calendar") for removal of past events,
- Code cleanup of plugin settings page.

1.10.2 (iionly and Matt Beckett)
--------------------------------

- iCAL import/export support by integration of the Event Calendar iCal plugin (this feature can be enabled/disabled by a new plugin setting),
- Fixed: repeating events can no longer be created without selection at least on day of week the repeating event should take place on,
- Workaround added for the site menu's "More" dropdown being overlayed by parts of the calendar if the full view event listing format is used (the workaround consists of overriding Elgg core's elgg-menu-site class; if your theme plugin or any other plugin ordered below the Event Calendar plugin does also override this class that is defined in views/default/css/elements/navigation.php the workaround is likely to fail),
- Title in event popup display when using the full view event listing format is now a link forwarding to the event's full view page,
- Cleanup of edit event form html markup and making the look of the form more "Elggish",
- Parameters of elgg_view_entity_list() calls adjusted to new form of this function,

0.85
----

- Requires: Elgg 1.8 or higher
- Should be installed in mod/event_calendar

0.84
----

- Fixed tag search so it works for Elgg 1.7.x
- Added French and Spanish language files provided by UNESCO. These are not quite complete and additions are welcome
- There is now an option to allow group admins to add any existing event to a group calendar
- Fixed a bug which incorrectly removed the ability to change the date and year
- Renamed a date picker view to avoid a conflict with the Profile Manager
- Added unpacked js for ease in customisation and localisation
- Restored the vanished RSS feed link
- Fixed a bug in the region dropdown behaviour on listing pages
- Fixed a case where the page was not properly displayed when clicking on a pagination link
- Added a sanity check for date formats
- Changed the listing limit from 4 events to a more reasonable 15 events
- Added real_end_time as an internal metadata value to compute collisions
- Added three features that are turned off by default but can be enabled through plugin settings:
   1. The spots feature allows you to specify how many users can add an event to their personal calendars. This also adds an "open" filter to the show events page so that you can see how many events are not full
   2. The no collisions feature prevents someone from adding an event if they already have another event on their personal calendar within the same time period. (This will only work with new events or events that you have resaved after updating this plugin as it needs the new real_end_time field)
   3. The add users feature provides a magic JavaScript field that allows an event creator to add the event to the personal calendars of other users. This appears on the event edit form. (Requires the separate autocomplete plugin)
- There is a separate option (turned off by default) to send notifications to users who have events added to their calendars through the add users feature
