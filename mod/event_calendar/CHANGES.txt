== Version history ==

=== 1.8.1 (iionly and Juho Jaakola) ===

- If event's long description is available, display it on event full view page
- Cleanup of entity_list view (no longer use deprecated navigation/viewtype view that were unnecessary to be used anyway)
- Use elgg_is_active_plugin() instead of elgg_plugin_exists() to make sure the helper plugins are enabled before using them

=== 1.8.0 (iionly and Juho Jaakola) ===

- Major code cleanup
- Adds upgrade script to convert old handling of personal events (with annotations) to new implementation (handled by relationships)
- Fixed remaining deprecation issues appearing on Elgg 1.8
- Updated to version 1.6.4 of FullCalendar jQuery plugin
- Rework of UI: consolidation of breakcrump usage, title and body sections in event's full view and list views, filter menu, sidebar (in short: look and feel should be much more like other Elgg plugins)
- Getting sending of reminders (when message_queue plugin is installed) to work on Elgg 1.8
- Correctly list open events (events with a limited number of spots that still have free spots) on the open events tab
- Correctly display html editor (Tinymce) for longtext input fields both with the bundled Tinymce editor plugin and a Tinymce plugin that uses version 4.X of the Tinymce editor
- Correctly display share section when adding/editing an event if the Entity Admins plugin is installed
- It's now possible to translate the calendar UI (at least the parts allowed to translate by the FullCalendar jQuery plugin)
- Uses default userpicker instead of custom one
- Support of index page and group profile page widgets (for use with Widget Manager plugin)
- Adds German translations
- Adds Spanish translations (thanks to Yaco)
- Adds Finnish translations (incomplete)
- Adds Japanese translations (incomplete)

=== 0.85 ===

- Requires: Elgg 1.8 or higher
- Should be installed in mod/event_calendar

=== 0.84 ===

- Fixed tag search so it works for Elgg 1.7.x
- Added French and Spanish language files provided by UNESCO. These are not quite complete and additions are welcome
- There is now an option to allow group admins to add any existing event to a group calendar
- Fixed a bug which incorrectly removed the ability to change the date and year
- Renamed a date picker view to avoid a conflict with the Profile Manager
- Added unpacked js for ease in customisation and localisation
- Restored the vanished RSS feed link
- Fixed a bug in the region dropdown behaviour on listing pages
- Fixed a case where the page was not properly displayed when clicking on a pagination link
- Added a sanity check for date formats
- Changed the listing limit from 4 events to a more reasonable 15 events
- Added real_end_time as an internal metadata value to compute collisions
- Added three features that are turned off by default but can be enabled through plugin settings:
   1. The spots feature allows you to specify how many users can add an event to their personal calendars. This also adds an "open" filter to the show events page so that you can see how many events are not full
   2. The no collisions feature prevents someone from adding an event if they already have another event on their personal calendar within the same time period. (This will only work with new events or events that you have resaved after updating this plugin as it needs the new real_end_time field)
   3. The add users feature provides a magic JavaScript field that allows an event creator to add the event to the personal calendars of other users. This appears on the event edit form. (Requires the separate autocomplete plugin)
- There is a separate option (turned off by default) to send notifications to users who have events added to their calendars through the add users feature

- Added the ability to "lock" the show_events page so that the calendar only allows navigation between a first date and a last date
- Added an admin toggle for an autogroup function that automatically adds all group events to a user's calendar for all groups that the user is a member of. Group events are also automatically removed if the user leaves the group
- Added an admin toggle to add a region drop down to the event form and a field to enter the allowable regions

- Added the ability to view all/friends/mine events for logged-in users
- Added numerous configuration options (accessible via event_calendar settings on the admin tools configuration page). This allows, for example, any logged-in user to add events to the site calendar, to remove group calendars, etc.
- People who create an event now have the event automatically added to their personal event calendar. This behaviour can be configured via the admin event calendar settings
