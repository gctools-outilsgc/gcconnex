Description
-----------

The event_calendar plugin adds a site-wide event calendar as well as an event calendar to each group. Various options related to the site and group calendars can be set using the event calendar settings on the tool administration page.

Group members can view events by month, week and day using a jQuery date picker widget, and submit event descriptions including the venue, start date, end date, tags, description, organiser, contact person, event access level, and fees if any.

Group events are aggregated into the site wide event calendar accessible from the Tools menu drop down.

Site admins (or optionally any user) can also add non-group-specific events to the site-wide calendar.

Users can add group or site-wide events to a personal calendar to showcase events that they plan to attend or are interested in. They can optionally display these events by dragging an Event calendar widget onto their profile or dashboard.

The number of users who have added an event to their personal gallery is listed on each event page along with a link to a page that displays these users in a gallery format. It is thus easy to find other people interested in the same event.

Users can export to or import events from an iCal file.


Admin settings
--------------

Numerous options for the event calendar can be set in the event_calendar settings area under Tool Administration.

These include:

* Add starting and ending times as well as dates to events (default: no)

* Automatically add events a user creates to his/her personal calendar (default: yes)

* Automatically add group events for all members to their personal calendars (default: no) (If activated, the autogroup function automatically adds all group events to a user's calendar for all groups that the user is a member of. Group events are also automatically removed if the user leaves the group.)

* Use Agenda view (default: no) (Useful for conferences with multiple events on the same day.)

* Display venue in event listings (default: no)

* Add region dropdown (default: no), plus a way to specify the allowable regions

* First date displayable on show events pages (default: no first date)

* Last date displayable on show events pages (default: no last date)

As well, there are numerous options for configuring the site wide and group calendars.

Pete Harris from Curverider contributed the icons. Thanks Pete!

Igor Nuk from UNESCO sent me Spanish and French language files as well as a version tweaked to make it easier to customise.

Many clients too numerous to mention have funded enhancements since the original version was funded by the Royal Institute of British Architects.
